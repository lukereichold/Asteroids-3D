# Final Exam Progress

## Done - Suggested features:
- (60 pt) progress label
- (10 pt) added name / date
- (20 pt) Fixed "Audio Buffer" sound error
- (60 pt) Asteroids now vary in both size and color

## Done - Other vital fixes / enhancements:
- fixed edge case where game didn't end when last asteroid was destroyed by hitting ship w/ at least 1 shield
- simplified initial asteroid starting positions; refactored ship collision logic
- Refactored 'game / ship reset' functionality
- Now iterate over asteroids and bullets array in reverse in order to prevent logic error where asteroids are not completely removed on game reset.
- Fixed error that caused lingering bullets upon game reset

## Other notes:
- removed "sun" object, so it's not confused for an asteroid
- updated my screenshot
- all these changes are tracked via git in my /WWW project directory
- identified a bug -- after end of game the ship still starts with some velocity if ship died while holding down arrow keys.
    - to fix this, try stopping listening for keyboard events as soon as window alert, and resume listener at the end of resetShip()
    - this will prevent a build-up of pending ship.accelerate() calls
- Eventually I plan on modifying DeviceOrientationControls so I can appropriately 1) accelerate and 2) update the shoot direction when played using Google Cardboard on a mobile device.
